# 🧠 Fashion MNIST Image Classifier (.exe GUI App)

This desktop application lets users upload an image (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.) of a clothing item and predicts what item it is, using a neural network trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Built in Python with **TensorFlow**, **Pillow**, and a **Tkinter GUI**, it can be bundled into a Windows `.exe` for easy distribution.

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 Trains a neural network on Fashion MNIST  
- 🖼 User uploads an image from disk  
- 🔍 Automatically cleans/handles `.jfif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` (even truncated files)  
- 📊 Predicts one of 10 fashion categories (T-shirt, boot, dress, …)  
- ✅ Ships as a standalone `.exe` via PyInstaller  
- 🧪 Shows a human-readable prediction popup  

## 📁 Project Structure
```
📦 HumanBrain_tensorflow/
├── train_model.py          # Train and save the Fashion MNIST model
├── predict_gui.py          # GUI: load model, pick image, show prediction
├── fashion_model.h5        # Saved model (generated by training)
├── requirements.txt        # Exact package versions (frozen from venv)
├── README.md               # You’re here!

```

## 🛠 Setup (for developers)

1. **Create & activate** a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install exact dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> All package versions are pinned in `requirements.txt`, so every developer gets identical libraries.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1 – Train the model (first time only)
```bash
python train_model.py
```
Creates `fashion_model.h5`.

### 2 – Run the GUI
```bash
python predict_gui.py
```
—or run the compiled version—
```bash
./dist/predict_gui.exe
```
Steps:
1. Click **“Choose Image and Predict”**  
2. Select a `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`  
3. Read the prediction popup!

## 📦 Build the `.exe`
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed predict_gui.py
```
Copy `fashion_model.h5` into `dist/` next to `predict_gui.exe`.

> The `.exe` can be shared or used on any Windows machine—no Python required.

## 🧪 Known Limitations
- Current model: simple Dense layer, 5 epochs → modest accuracy  
- Misclassifies noisy/background images  
- Improve with CNN layers, more epochs, better preprocessing  

## ✅ To-Do / Next Steps
- [ ] Switch to Conv2D + MaxPool architecture  
- [ ] Train for 10–15 epochs  
- [ ] Show image preview before prediction  
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop support  
- [ ] Bundle model file inside the `.exe`
- [ ] Increase accuracy of model to at least 90% given same MNIST dataset
